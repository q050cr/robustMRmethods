@article{QiChatterjee_2021,
	abstract = {{Previous studies have often evaluated methods for Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis based on simulations that do not adequately reflect the data-generating mechanisms in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and there are often discrepancies in the performance of MR methods in simulations and real data sets.We use a simulation framework that generates data on full GWAS for two traits under a realistic model for effect-size distribution coherent with the heritability, co-heritability and polygenicity typically observed for complex traits. We further use recent data generated from GWAS of 38 biomarkers in the UK Biobank and performed down sampling to investigate trends in estimates of causal effects of these biomarkers on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).Simulation studies show that weighted mode and MRMix are the only two methods that maintain the correct type I error rate in a diverse set of scenarios. Between the two methods, MRMix tends to be more powerful for larger GWAS whereas the opposite is true for smaller sample sizes. Among the other methods, random-effect IVW (inverse-variance weighted method), MR-Robust and MR-RAPS (robust adjust profile score) tend to perform best in maintaining a low mean-squared error when the InSIDE assumption is satisfied, but can produce large bias when InSIDE is violated. In real-data analysis, some biomarkers showed major heterogeneity in estimates of their causal effects on the risk of T2D across the different methods and estimates from many methods trended in one direction with increasing sample size with patterns similar to those observed in simulation studies.The relative performance of different MR methods depends heavily on the sample sizes of the underlying GWAS, the proportion of valid instruments and the validity of the InSIDE assumption. Down-sampling analysis can be used in large GWAS for the possible detection of bias in the MR methods.}},

@article{So_2011,
	abstract = {Abstract Recently, an increasing number of susceptibility variants have been identified for complex diseases. At the same time, the concern of ``missing heritability'' has also emerged. There is however no unified way to assess the heritability explained by individual genetic variants for binary outcomes. A systemic and quantitative assessment of the degree of ``missing heritability'' for complex diseases is lacking. In this study, we measure the variance in liability explained by individual variants, which can be directly interpreted as the locus-specific heritability. The method is extended to deal with haplotypes, multi-allelic markers, multi-locus genotypes, and markers in linkage disequilibrium. Methods to estimate the standard error and confidence interval are proposed. To assess our current level of understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases, we conducted a survey of 10 diseases, evaluating the total variance explained by the known variants. The diseases under evaluation included Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, coronary artery disease, Crohn's disease, prostate cancer, schizophrenia, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The median total variance explained across the 10 diseases was 9.81\%, while the median variance explained per associated SNP was around 0.25\%. Our results suggest that a substantial proportion of heritability remains unexplained for the diseases under study.

@article{Hoffmann_2018,
	abstract = {{Body mass index (BMI), a proxy measure for obesity, is determined by both environmental (including ethnicity, age, and sex) and genetic factors, with \\&gt; 400 BMI-associated loci identified to date. However, the impact, interplay, and underlying biological mechanisms among BMI, environment, genetics, and ancestry are not completely understood. To further examine these relationships, we utilized 427,509 calendar year-averaged BMI measurements from 100,418 adults from the single large multiethnic Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We observed substantial independent ancestry and nationality differences, including ancestry principal component interactions and nonlinear effects. To increase the list of BMI-associated variants before assessing other differences, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in GERA, with replication in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropomorphic Traits (GIANT) consortium combined with the UK Biobank (UKB), followed by GWAS in GERA combined with GIANT, with replication in the UKB. We discovered 30 novel independent BMI loci (P \\&lt; 5.0 {\~A}--- 10{\^a}ˆ'8) that replicated. We then assessed the proportion of BMI variance explained by sex in the UKB using previously identified loci compared to previously and newly identified loci and found slight increases: from 3.0 to 3.3\\% for males and from 2.7 to 3.0\\% for females. Further, the variance explained by previously and newly identified variants decreased with increasing age in the GERA and UKB cohorts, echoed in the variance explained by the entire genome, which also showed gene{\^a}€``age interaction effects. Finally, we conducted a tissue expression QTL enrichment analysis, which revealed that GWAS BMI-associated variants were enriched in the cerebellum, consistent with prior work in humans and mice.}},
